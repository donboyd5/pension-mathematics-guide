# Pension modeling guidebook

Goal of this project is to prepare a compact, accurate, complete, computer-readable guidebook of pension functions and methods that Claude or other AI can use to help in code analysis and development for a pension simulation model written in R.

The root folder is the parent of the claude/ folder that this file is in.

## Instructions to Claude

* read all qmd files in the root folder and the content/ folder under root
* let me know what permissions you need to always have the ability to update files and work with git
* let me know if you are able to read the "Pension modeling guidebook" project in my anthropic account. If you can't, is there a way I can give you permissions to read it?
* After that, we'll create a todo list below

## Claude observations and recommendations

### Strengths of the Current Guide
1. **Well-structured content**: The 11-chapter organization flows logically from basic concepts to implementation and validation
2. **Mathematical rigor**: Formulas are presented in both mathematical notation and code-ready format
3. **Practical implementation**: Working R code examples throughout make concepts immediately usable
4. **Academic grounding**: Proper citations to established actuarial literature with references.bib file
5. **Validation framework**: Chapter 10 demonstrates how to verify calculations with fundamental equations
6. **Comprehensive mortality implementation**: Chapter 7 includes survival functions, life annuities, and multiple decrement tables

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **Limited error handling**: Code examples lack robust error checking and edge case handling
2. **No unit tests**: While validation examples exist, formal unit test coverage would strengthen reliability
3. **Simplified mortality tables**: Using basic Gompertz-Makeham instead of standard industry tables (RP-2014, Pri-2012)
4. **Missing Python examples**: Despite mentions of Python compatibility, all code is in R only
5. **No data structures documentation**: Need clear specification of input/output data formats for AI integration
6. **Limited plan type coverage**: Focus mainly on traditional DB plans, less on cash balance, hybrid plans

### Recommendations for AI/Claude Integration
1. **Create a structured API specification** defining:
   - Input parameter schemas for each calculation type
   - Expected output formats with units and precision requirements
   - Error codes and handling procedures
   
2. **Add a "Quick Reference" section** with:
   - Function signatures for all major calculations
   - Parameter ranges and constraints
   - Common use case templates
   - Decision trees for choosing appropriate methods

3. **Develop test datasets** including:
   - Sample participant populations
   - Standard mortality/interest rate scenarios  
   - Expected results for validation
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions

4. **Include computational considerations**:
   - Performance benchmarks for large populations
   - Memory requirements for different calculation types
   - Vectorization strategies for R
   - Parallelization opportunities

5. **Expand practical examples** for:
   - Multi-employer plans
   - Cash balance plans
   - Hybrid DB/DC arrangements
   - GASB 67/68 vs FASB ASC 715 reporting differences
   - Non-US pension systems

### Technical Improvements Needed
1. **Add defensive programming**:
   - Input validation for all functions
   - Graceful handling of missing data
   - Boundary condition checks
   - Clear error messages

2. **Enhance the R6 implementation** (Chapter 9):
   - Add methods for experience studies
   - Implement gain/loss analysis
   - Add projection capabilities
   - Include asset modeling

3. **Create helper utilities**:
   - Data import/export functions
   - Report generation templates
   - Assumption set management
   - Scenario comparison tools

4. **Documentation enhancements**:
   - Add flowcharts for calculation processes
   - Include decision matrices for method selection
   - Provide troubleshooting guides
   - Create a glossary of terms
