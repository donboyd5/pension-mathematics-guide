# Financial Economics Approach

## Augmented Balance Sheet
Following the framework established by the financial economics literature [@aaa_soa_2006], pension plans are viewed as corporate assets and liabilities:

**Corporate Balance Sheet Integration:**
```
Total_Corporate_Assets = Operating_Assets + Net_Pension_Assets
Total_Corporate_Liabilities = Operating_Liabilities + Net_Pension_Liabilities
```

**Tax Adjustments:**
```
Net_Pension_Assets = Gross_Pension_Assets * (1 - Corporate_Tax_Rate)
Net_Pension_Liabilities = Gross_Pension_Liabilities * (1 - Corporate_Tax_Rate)
```

## Market-Based Liability Valuation
```
Market_Liability = Î£ benefit_cash_flows * market_discount_factors
```

Where market discount factors reflect the credit risk and timing of benefit payments.
