# Cost Methods

## Unit Credit Method
Allocates costs based on benefits accrued each year under the plan formula.

**Normal Cost:**
```
NC = present_value_of_benefit_accrued_in_current_year
```

**Actuarial Liability:**
```
AL = present_value_of_benefits_accrued_to_date
```

## Projected Unit Credit Method
Like Unit Credit but incorporates expected future salary increases.

**For final average pay plans:**
```
Projected_Annual_Benefit = k * (years_of_service) * (1/n) * Î£(final_n_years_salary)
```
Where:

- `k` = benefit multiplier (e.g., 0.015 for 1.5%)
- `n` = averaging period

```{r}
#| label: benefit-calculation
# Final average pay benefit calculation
calculate_final_average_benefit <- function(
  years_of_service,
  final_salaries,
  benefit_multiplier
) {
  average_salary <- mean(final_salaries)
  return(years_of_service * average_salary * benefit_multiplier)
}

# Example
final_5_salaries <- c(80000, 82000, 84000, 86000, 88000)
benefit_example <- calculate_final_average_benefit(30, final_5_salaries, 0.015)
cat("Annual benefit:", benefit_example)
```
